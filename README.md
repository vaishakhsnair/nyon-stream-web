# nyon-stream-web (WIP)
A Web-App to play anime from nyaa si using webtorrent

Made using a fork of [Nyon-Stream](https://github.com/Nixuge/nyon-stream)

uses python and native browser js or browserified nodejs packages

ON WINDOWS
  - run the dependency-installer.py to install the required stuff
  - change the paths for node and webtorrent (if applicable) and run web.py
  
 ON LINUX
  - Install node and webtorrent-cli globally
  - run web.py

What Works ?
  - Basic Playback and seeking works
  - Subtitles work for most of the anime in nyaa, bulk volumes don't work properly yet (have to figure out a way to identify them)
  - Multiple clients
