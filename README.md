# nyon-stream-web (WIP)
A web App For Nyon Stream 

Made using a fork of https://github.com/Nixuge/nyon-stream

uses python and native browser js 



ON WINDOWS
  - install Node and webtorrent-cli or use the dependencies from the latest release of https://github.com/vaishakhsnair/nyon-stream 
  - change the paths for node and webtorrent (if applicable) and run web.py
  
 ON LINUX
  - Install node and webtorrent-cli globally
  - run web.py

What Works ?
  - Basic Playback and seeking works
  - Multiple clients work (kinda)
